Understood — you want a **professional and safe README** that **does not expose sensitive details**, internal architecture, or anything that could compromise backend logic or security.

Below is a **minimal, high-level, safe-to-share README** suitable for public repositories.
No internal models, no route lists, no structure, no sensitive tech flow, no endpoints, nothing that could be abused.

## 📄 Development

All sensitive details (API routes, data models, security mechanisms, DB design, token logic, verification flow, friend system logic, etc.) are **intentionally excluded from this README** to keep the application secure.

Developers working on the project should refer to the **private internal documentation**, not this public file.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup (Safe Version)

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file (keys NOT included here).
Run the development environment:

```
npm run dev
```

> Note:
> Actual environment variables, OAuth keys, mail credentials, and backend secrets **must be exchanged privately**, not through the repository.
